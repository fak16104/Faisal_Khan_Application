As part of my undergraduate journey, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects. Below are some highlights:

---

##1. Research Project 1 - Dynamical Manifestations of Many-body Quantum Chaos

In collaboration with Professor Laa F. Santos and postdoc Isaias Vallejo over a summer and one semester, I worked on experiencng theoretical phyics in the quantum realm. I learned how to code in Fortran, plot in Grace, run Linux and overall deepen my understanding of quantum physics and random matrix theory.

##2. Research Project 2 - Lithium Magneto Optical Trap

In this project, I helped implement and design a lithium oven for a laser involving two magneto optical traps. I developed my understanding of optics and got hands on experience working with the laser and the fabricated components. This involved researching insulation methods and implementing my own improvements.

These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also given me a deeper appreciation for the collaborative nature of scientific research.

Stay tuned for more project deep dives!
