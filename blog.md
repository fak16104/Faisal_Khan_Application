### Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post on my professional portfolio website. I’m excited to share insights from my experiences in physics! Here are some of the things I plan to cover in future posts:

- Projects I’ve worked on, including my senior design project and internships.
- My journey in physics and the challenges I’ve overcome.

Stay tuned for more updates!
