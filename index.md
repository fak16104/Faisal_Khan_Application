Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am a Physics major with a minor in Astrophysics, graduating from the University of Connecticut in Spring 2026. With a current GPA of 3.444, I am passionate about physics outreach, quantum computing, and laser systems.

### About Me

I have gained hands-on experience through academic research projects that focus on both theoretical physics, coding simulations, and hands-on experience working with a lithium laser employing two magneto-optical traps (MOTs). I have worked with professors Lea F. Santos, PhD, and Daniel McCarron, PhD. My expertise includes:

- Programming: Python, MATLAB, Fortran, Julia

### Projects

- Research Project 1: Dynamical Manifestations of Many-body Quantum Chaos - using fortran to simulate a 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg spin chain.
- Research Project 2: Lithium MOT Laser - work with the lithium oven to prepare the laser for deployment as an outreach project to underserved high schools in Connecticut.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out for collaboration or opportunities.
